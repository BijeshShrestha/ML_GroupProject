  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>
    Between 20% to 40% of global crop production is lost due to pests annually. Furthermore, plant diseases cost the global economy around $220 billion according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [1]. 
  </p>
  <p>Research into the domain of plant disease detection using 
    computer vision capabilities has piqued the interest of 
    researchers from both the academic and industrial
    sides alike. We are growing accustomed to having various
    machine-learning applications that help us with difficult
    tasks, such as plant disease identification with varied levels
    of accuracy and usability.</p>
    <p>Many disease prediction efforts rely solely on examining
       images of plant leaves. However, there is an increasing
        demand for not only classifying diseases but also plant 
        species. A multi dimensional classification solution would
         be much more attractive, especially for large-scale crop 
         management.  </p>
    <p> This project is driven by
    the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
    significantly advance the identification process of plant
    ailments with a higher accuracy and efficiency that were
    previously unattainable.</p>
    <p> Our thesis explores advanced
    disease identification methods in plants through an active
    literature review and translating these techniques into a
    practical, user-friendly tool. We aim to expand on an
    existing researchers’ codebase to develop an open-source
    web application that can serve both as a sophisticated
    plant disease detection system and as an educational plat-
    form for future developers and researchers in the field.
    In this experiment, we make the following contributions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tool Function: Our tool leverages ML and deep-
        learning algorithms to accurately classify plant dis-
        ease from images that can be used for diagnosis and
        remediation suggestions.</li><br/>
        <li>
          Impact: Our tool will be a step forward in improv-
          ing global agriculture efforts, informing hobbyists,
          and inspiring aspiring researchers through access to
          a web platform that can be used as a product or boil-
          erplate code repository to develop the tool further.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Project Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The impact of this project lies in its ability to serve as a guide for future works. Future researchers can use this project as a reference and a starting point for their research. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A guide for plant disease classification can serve as an invaluable resource for a beginner in the field of machine learning by offering a comprehensive overview of both the practical application of machine learning techniques and the domain-specific challenges involved in diagnosing plant health. For novices, such a guide demystifies the process of applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems, providing a concrete example of how data can be collected, processed, and used to make predictions or decisions—in this case, identifying various plant diseases based on symptoms presented in images or data sets. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Furthermore, it introduces beginners to the interdisciplinary nature of applied machine learning, blending computer science with botany and plant pathology, thereby broadening their understanding and appreciation of the field. By tackling a specific task like plant disease classification, beginners can gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation metrics, all of which are foundational skills in machine learning. Additionally, such a guide can highlight the importance of domain expertise in developing effective machine learning solutions, showing how collaboration between machine learning practitioners and subject matter experts can lead to more accurate and meaningful outcomes.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> [4] reviewed current deep learning methods for 
    identifying plant species and detecting diseases from leaf images.
     Their review highlighted four key strategies:</p>

     <div>
      <img src="img/backbone model approaches.png" width="750", height="350">

     <div class="container">
     <div class="left_column">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Multi-Model</h3>
        <p>They constructed a dual-model ensemble comprising two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One model focused on identifying plant species from leaf images, while the other was dedicated to disease prediction. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the researchers employed various backbone CNN architectures for this approach, which included their custom model as well as established models like AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet101, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2.</p>
      </div>
     </div>
     <div class="right_column">
<div class="text">
  <h3>Multi-Label</h3>
  <p>They also created a single CNN architecture designed to output multiple ps. Additionally, this framework diverged from conventional multi-p learning methods mentioned in [5]. They combined  these ps to form a power-set p for predictions. Essentially,  utilized a unified p to represent multiple ps simultaneously. Additionally, they leveraged various backbone CNN architectures to support this methodology.</p>

              <h3>Multi-Output</h3>
              <p>The researchers also created a single CNN model, similar to the
               multi-p strategy. However, it differs by having 
               separate output layers for each classification target.</p>

  </div>

<div class="text">
  <p>Building on these methods, the authors introduced a novel 
    technique named Generalised Stacking Multi-output CNNs (GSMo-CNN).
    This method combines some strengths of the aforementioned
    approaches to enhance performance by creating a sequence of output 
    layers. This sequential structure forms a hierarchical 
    classification system aimed at accurately representing the 
    relationship between various plant species and their diseases 
    during analysis.</p> 
</div>
</div>
  
    
      <p>
        Furthermore, the study explored the effectiveness of 
        different CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3) 
        across all four strategies by testing them on three well-known 
        plant disease image datasets: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plant Village [2]
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            Plant Leaves [1] and,
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            Plant Doc [3]
          </li>
        </ul> InceptionV3 emerged as the superior CNN architecture 
        for identifying plant species and predicting diseases.

  <h2>Our Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    For this project, this team developed a 
    free-to-use guide for beginners to the field of 
    Machine Learning who want to create their own Plant Disease 
    Classifier. This team will outline the steps involved, 
    including preprocessing techniques, model architectures, and evaluation metrics needed to create a robust model.
  </p>

  <h3>Experimentation</h3>
  <p>Our team performed several experiemnts in an effort to improve on the authors' GSMo-CNN model. These efforts included:
    adding additional hidden layers and tuning several hyperparaeters. 
  </p>

  <h3>Tutorials</h3>
  <p>
    We have developed tutorials tailored to individuals with varying levels of proficiency in deep learning, ranging from novice to expert. These tutorials serve as a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for executing the original authors’ code, augmented with our own additions, to train a model and generate predictions. It is meticulously crafted to accommodate those with minimal experience in the operational aspects of deep learning.</p>

    <p>
      Engaging directly with the source code is irreplaceable in gaining a thorough understanding of the intricacies involved. Through customization of global parameters, such as model selection, dataset choice, batch size, epoch count, and iterations for performance metric consolidation via averaging, participants can glean invaluable insights into the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of deep learning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We cordially invite our readers to delve into the source code, notably 'train_models.py,' and acquaint themselves with the diverse architectural nuances. Additionally, readily available resources via web search or consultation with generative AI can clearly explain the functionalities of various layers and methods.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Furthermore, we advocate for experimentation with different global variables to observe how model performance is affected by alterations in these hyperparameters. The enigmatic nature of deep learning algorithms often yields fascinating results, underscoring their efficacy despite their inherent complexity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We believe that our readers will find the exploration of deep learning principles as captivating as we do, and we encourage thier active participation in this endeavor.
  </p>

<h3>Web Application</h3>
<p>As part of our free to use guide, our team developed a web application that will allow users to quickly classify plant species and diseases. Our team decided to also include a standalone Machine Learning 
product in which our readers can showcase the results of their model in a visually pleasing way.  
</p>

  <p>
    Our app allows a user to upload a picture of a plant. Then, the app will determine the plant's species and health, and will give some useful information on proper care and maintenance.
  </p>
  <h4>Here's A Prediction</h4>
  <img src="img/strawberrypreiction.png" alt="image prediction" width="850" height="600">

<p>
Please note that the app makes an API call to OpenAI's Large Languae Model (LLM) in order to generate the additional 
information on care and maintenance. If the users of our do not have an API key, the app will only classify the plant species and disease.
