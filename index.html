  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>Research into the domain of plant disease detection using 
    computer vision capabilities has piqued the interest of 
    researchers from both the academic and industrial
    sides alike. We are growing accustomed to having various
    machine-learning applications that help us with difficult
    tasks, such as plant disease identification with varied levels
    of accuracy and usability.</p>
    <p>Many disease prediction efforts rely solely on examining
       images of plant leaves. However, there is an increasing
        demand for not only classifying diseases but also plant 
        species. A multi dimensional classification solution would
         be much more attractive, especially for large-scale crop 
         management.  </p>
    <p> This project is driven by
    the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
    significantly advance the identification process of plant
    ailments with a higher accuracy and efficiency that were
    previously unattainable.</p>
    <p> Our thesis explores advanced
    disease identification methods in plants through an active
    literature review and translating these techniques into a
    practical, user-friendly tool. We aim to expand on an
    existing researchers’ codebase to develop an open-source
    web application that can serve both as a sophisticated
    plant disease detection system and as an educational plat-
    form for future developers and researchers in the field.
    In this experiment, we make the following contribu-
    tions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tool Function: Our tool leverages ML and deep-
        learning algorithms to accurately classify plant dis-
        ease from images that can be used for diagnosis and
        remediation suggestions.</li><br/>
        <li>
          Impact: Our tool will be a step forward in improv-
          ing global agriculture efforts, informing hobbyists,
          and inspiring aspiring researchers through access to
          a web platform that can be used as a product or boil-
          erplate code repository to develop the tool further.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p> [4] reviewed current deep learning methods for 
    identifying plant species and detecting diseases from leaf images.
     The review highlighted four key strategies:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
        multi-model: Use two CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models on leaf 
        images, with one model identifying plant species and the other
        diagnosing leaf diseases.</li><br/>
        <li>
          multi-label: Employ a single CNN model to generate multiple labels 
          simultaneously, unlike traditional multi-label learning. 
          This strategy merges labels into a combined power-set label 
          for both training and identification purposes.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
          multi-output: Use a single CNN model, similar to the
           multi-label strategy. However, it differs by having 
           separate output layers for each classification target.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
          Adopt a multi-task learning framework that targets 
          different objectives using data from the same dataset.
        </li>      
     </ul>
     <p>Building on these methods, the authors introduced a novel 
      technique named Generalised Stacking Multi-output CNNs (GSMo-CNN).
      This method combines some strengths of the aforementioned
      approaches to enhance performance by creating a sequence of output 
      layers. This sequential structure forms a hierarchical 
      classification system aimed at accurately representing the 
      relationship between various plant species and their diseases 
      during analysis.</p> 
      <p>
        Furthermore, the study explored the effectiveness of 
        different CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3) 
        across all four strategies by testing them on three well-known 
        plant disease image datasets: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plant Village [2]
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            Plant Leaves [1] and,
          </li><br/>
          <li>
            Plant Doc [3]
          </li>
        </ul> InceptionV3 emerged as the superior CNN architecture 
        for identifying plant species and predicting diseases.

  <h2>Existing Technologies</h2>
  <p>There are several commercially available apps
     that can identify infected plants. Some of these apps include:
     <ul>
      <li>
        “PlantSaver – Plants Identifier”
      </li><br/>
      <li>
        “Agrio” and
      </li><br/>
      <li>
        “Plant Disease Identifier”
      </li><br/>
     </ul>         
      All apps are all available on the Apple App Store. 
      Each app allows the user to take a picture of a plant, 
      and the app will determine whether or not the plant is 
      healthy. It is important to note that each app requires 
      a monthly subscription for uninterrupted usage. 
      Additionally, “Agrio” is the only service that offers 
      a web-based application, which requires a monthly 
      subscription. </p>

  <h2>Our Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    For this project, this team will develop a 
    free-to-use guide for beginners to the field of 
    Machine Learning who want to create their own Plant Disease 
    Classifier. This team will outline the steps involved, 
    including preprocessing techniques, model architectures, and evaluation metrics needed to create a robust model.
  </p>
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The impact of this project lies in its ability to serve as a guide for future works. Future researchers can use this project as a reference and a starting point for their research. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A guide for plant disease classification can serve as an invaluable resource for a beginner in the field of machine learning by offering a comprehensive overview of both the practical application of machine learning techniques and the domain-specific challenges involved in diagnosing plant health. For novices, such a guide demystifies the process of applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems, providing a concrete example of how data can be collected, processed, and used to make predictions or decisions—in this case, identifying various plant diseases based on symptoms presented in images or data sets. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Furthermore, it introduces beginners to the interdisciplinary nature of applied machine learning, blending computer science with botany and plant pathology, thereby broadening their understanding and appreciation of the field. By tackling a specific task like plant disease classification, beginners can gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation metrics, all of which are foundational skills in machine learning. Additionally, such a guide can highlight the importance of domain expertise in developing effective machine learning solutions, showing how collaboration between machine learning practitioners and subject matter experts can lead to more accurate and meaningful outcomes.
