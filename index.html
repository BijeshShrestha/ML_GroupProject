  <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
  <p>Research into the domain of plant disease detection us-
    ing computer vision capabilities has piqued the inter-
    est of researchers from both the academic and industrial
    sides alike. We are growing accustomed to having various
    machine-learning applications that help us with difficult
    tasks, such as plant disease identification with varied lev-
    els of accuracy and usability. This project is driven by
    the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
    significantly advance the identification process of plant
    ailments with a higher accuracy and efficiency that were
    previously unattainable. Our thesis explores advanced
    disease identification methods in plants through an active
    literature review and translating these techniques into a
    practical, user-friendly tool. We aim to expand on an
    existing researchers’ codebase to develop an open-source
    web application that can serve both as a sophisticated
    plant disease detection system and as an educational plat-
    form for future developers and researchers in the field.
    In this experiment, we make the following contribu-
    tions:

    • Tool Function: Our tool leverages ML and deep-
    learning algorithms to accurately classify plant dis-
    ease from images that can be used for diagnosis and
    remediation suggestions.
    
    • Impact: Our tool will be a step forward in improv-
    ing global agriculture efforts, informing hobbyists,
    and inspiring aspiring researchers through access to
    a web platform that can be used as a product or boil-
    erplate code repository to develop the tool further.</p>
